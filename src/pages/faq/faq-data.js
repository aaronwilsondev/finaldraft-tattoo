        question: "How much will my tattoo cost?",
        answer: "This depends on several factors, including the complexity of the design and the placement of the piece, the level of detail involved, as well as your own stamina. While its possible for us to give estimates over the phone or online, the best way to get an accurate price for a piece is come in and have a chat with us about your design and placement. We can give you some advice, and let you know how long it’s likely to take and how much it will cost – however, this is an approximate quote, so please be prepared for this to change, especially if you make changes to the design or placement on the day."

We will not pierce or tattoo anyone who appears to be drunk or stoned and any customers arriving to the studio in this state will be turned away and their deposits forfeit."
